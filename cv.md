## About Me:

I work as a leading specialist of the tender department. In 2019, I had completed the course work for a PhD in water supply. Recently, I drew attention to such a profession as a front-end developer. 
I think this is a promising direction of development. My strength is that I adapt easily and quickly to a new environment and know how to make decisions and take responsibility for them
